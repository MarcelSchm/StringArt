# StringArt
My own approach for StringArt creation. In first instance, I want to have support for creation of the frame with nails.

## Frame
Frame can either be circular or rectangular. For now we start with circular. You should be able to select the diameter of circle and number of nails or distance between nails. with this, a DXF file should be created, that can be used for a first marking on the MDF Plate with Points that show where the nails must go and with numbers to identify them.
